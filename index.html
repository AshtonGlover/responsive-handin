        <h2>Choosing My Site</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, I wanted to choose an outdated website and utilize
          my design skills to reformat the site in a more intuitive, modern
          format. My mind immediately went in the direction of town websites, as
          many of them are extremely outdated and old. I then discovered
          Eutawville, one of the least populated towns in my home state of South
          Carolina. The current site,
          <a href="https://www.eutawvillesc.org/" target="_blank"
            >https://www.eutawvillesc.org/</a
          >, looks like below:
        </p>
        <img src="images/original.png" alt="original site" />
        <p>
          Based on this, I identified the following issues with the current
          design:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Currently the page lacks any real organization. Most of the
            information is just scattered all over the page without any clear
            hierarchy or organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            The nav-bar has really poor contrast with its hover effect. It is
            difficult to see the sub-headings when the hover highlight also
            exists.
          </li>
          <li>
            The page is not designed to fit on a screen with a large width;
            there's just empty space to the left and right.
          </li>
          <li>
            The WebAIM WAVE tool noted many issues with contrast as I discussed
            above. Otherwise, it mostly just noticed areas with missing alt text
            and text-size issues, as well as areas where there was underlined
            text. I agree with these problems, especially the contrast issues.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Redesigning</h2>
        <p>
          After evaluating the website's current issues as described above, I
          turned to Figma to work on a redesign to address the issues and
          improve the overall look of the page. I designed a version of the page
          for large computers, tablets, and mobile devices, all of which are
          within the Figma file embedded below.
        </p>
        <iframe
          style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
          width="800"
          height="500"
          src="https://embed.figma.com/design/xjlwrAVM2kTMsExGnfa5qS/Redesign?node-id=0-1&embed-host=share"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <p>
          The key changes between the different screen sizes are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The mobile nav-bar is in the hamburger style, where the options
            expand after clicking on the button. The tablet and desktop versions
            opt for the more traditional nav-bar with elements horizontally
            arranged along the top of the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            The contact information for the mobile version is in column format
            rather than row to allow for better spacing.
          </li>
          <li>Font sizes get increasingly larger for larger screen sizes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When making changes to the website, I sought to improve on the user
          experience while keeping the content the same. I wanted users to be
          able to access the same information, just in a much more accessible
          way. To do this, I did the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I organized the information into three major categories, town
            information, payment, and contact information, and then presented
            that information as its own block within an overall column.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also improved the contrast on the nav-bar hover effect, making it
            much easier for a user to determine when they were hovering over a
            certain element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Furthermore, I made the page fit the entire screen, removing the
            white space on the sides of the original.
          </li>
          <li>I also made sure to add alt text where appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With all of these changes, I hope a user would be able to better
          navigate the page and locate whatever information they are hoping to
          find. Additionally, by improving contrast, users should also be

        <h2>Final Product</h2>
        <p>
          Keeping all of this in mind, I utilized HTML and CSS to build a
          functioning prototype of the new website. This website can be accessed
          at
          <a
            href="https://ashtonglover.github.io/eutawville-redesign/"
            target="_blank"
            >https://ashtonglover.github.io/eutawville-redesign/</a
          >. The website is designed to be responsive, so it should work on any
          screen size.
        </p>

        <iframe
          style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"

        <p>
          The above is an embedded version of the website just to get a quick
          overview. It shows the page with many of the mobile features due to
          the reduced width, such as the hamburger nav-bar and column format for
          the contact information. To view all of the different states for the
          website, click the link.

          Desiging a responsive web application proved rather difficult. Keeping
          multiple screen sizes in mind and ensuring that all elements resize
          appropriately takes careful consideration and planning. The process of
          identifying the key issues, mocking up my pages in Figma, and then
          working on the actual product assisted greatly in this process. By
          iteratively working on the project, I feel as though I was able to
          address user concerns and rework the page to be accessible for all.
